[Generating Images using Generative Adverserial Networks](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/06-mnist-gan)\n\nContinuing where the [previous tutorial](https://jvn.io/aakashns/3143ceb92b4f4cbbb4f30e203580b77b) left off, we'll discuss one of the foundational  algorithms of machine learning in this post: *Linear regression*. We'll create a model that predicts crop yields for apples and oranges (*target variables*) by looking at the average temperature, rainfall and humidity (*input variables or features*) in a region. Here's the training data:\n\n![linear-regression-training-data](https://i.imgur.com/6Ujttb4.png)\n\nIn a linear regression model, each target variable is estimated to be a weighted sum of the input variables, offset by some constant, known as a bias :\n\n```\nyield_apple  = w11 * temp + w12 * rainfall + w13 * humidity + b1\nyield_orange = w21 * temp + w22 * rainfall + w23 * humidity + b2\n```\n\nVisually, it means that the yield of apples is a linear or planar function of temperature, rainfall and humidity:\n\n![linear-regression-graph](https://i.imgur.com/4DJ9f8X.png)\n\nThe *learning* part of linear regression is to figure out a set of weights `w11, w12,... w23, b1 & b2` by looking at the training data, to make accurate predictions for new data (i.e. to predict the yields for apples and oranges in a new region using the average temperature, rainfall and humidity). This is done by adjusting the weights slightly many times to make better predictions, using an optimization technique called *gradient descent*."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## System setup\n\nThis tutorial takes a code-first approach towards learning PyTorch, and you should try to follow along by running and experimenting with the code yourself. The easiest way to start executing this notebook is to click the **\"Run\"** button at the top of this page, and select **\"Run on Binder\"**. This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks.\n\n**NOTE**: *If you're running this notebook on Binder, please skip ahead to the next section.*\n\n### Running on your computer locally\n\nYou can clone this notebook hosted on [Jovian.ml](https://www.jovian.ml), install the required dependencies, and start Jupyter by running the following commands on the terminal:\n\n```bash\npip install jovian --upgrade    # Install the jovian library \njovian clone aakashns/02-linear-regression      # Download notebook & dependencies\ncd 02-linear-regression         # Enter the created directory \njovian install                  # Install the dependencies\nconda activate 02-linear-regression # Activate virtual environment\njupyter notebook                # Start Jupyter\n```\n\nOn older versions of conda, you might need to run `source activate 02-linear-regression` to activate the environment. For a more detailed explanation of the above steps, check out the *System setup* section in the [previous notebook](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/01-pytorch-basics)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We begin by importing Numpy and PyTorch:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Uncomment the command below if Numpy or PyTorch is not installed\n# !conda install numpy pytorch cpuonly -c pytorch -y","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport torch","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Training data\n\nThe training data can be represented using 2 matrices: `inputs` and `targets`, each with one row per observation, and one column per variable."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Input (temp, rainfall, humidity)\ninputs = np.array([[73, 67, 43], \n                   [91, 88, 64], \n                   [87, 134, 58], \n                   [102, 43, 37], \n                   [69, 96, 70]], dtype='float32')","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Targets (apples, oranges)\ntargets = np.array([[56, 70], \n                    [81, 101], \n                    [119, 133], \n                    [22, 37], \n                    [103, 119]], dtype='float32')","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We've separated the input and target variables, because we'll operate on them separately.
